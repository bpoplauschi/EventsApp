# Events Coding Challenge

## Coding challenge for iOS developer @ Vivid Seats

Simple app that fetches data and populates it on screen

## Challenge description

For this coding exercise, you must fetch data from a REST API and populate a list on screen. While the scope of this task is small, imagine your solution will be applied to a full scale application.

Add however much flair and polish you think appropriately showcases your talents as a mobile developer. Be sure to use Kotlin/Java for an Android solution, or Swift for an iOS solution.

Please see the included Example.png for what you should aim for your UI to look like. Your UI does not have to match exactly, this is simply an example.

You will be evaluated based on:
- Use of best practices 
- Scalability 
- Testability

## Requirements

- Xcode 13
- iOS 14.0 or above (a good practice is to support one major version behind the current one)
